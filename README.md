# Let's Delivery Frontend Test

### Code observation

While building this project I focused more on **clean code**. Ensuring that the code is **100%** **readable**, **understandable**, **maintainable** and **scalable**. I do understand that the **UI** can be improved, but I didn't put to much effort on create a super appealing application to the eye. But a fully **functional**, **scalable** and code that can be trusted because of the **tests**.
